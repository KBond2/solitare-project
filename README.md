TO DO:
- Give user ability to transfer cards (L/K)
    - User selects card (since it has to be the last card in a pile, by pile?)
    - Card gets moved from its original position to a new position of the user's choice
    - Check if the location the user chooses is a valid position (ie, the card rank is one lower than the one before it, and the opposite suit color)

    - User can draw one card from the stock (deck), and play it, if they are physically unable to play this card it goes to the waste
- Display cards (S)
    - Setup the board
    - Figure out colors(?)
