(temp using for to do list)
TO DO:
- Create Waste pile (discard) & Foundation (win condition) piles
    - Foundation needs to be a specific order of cards, with the ace of a specific type on the bottom, going up to king
    - One foundation pile of each type
    - Waste pile is where a card that cannot be placed goes
- Give user ability to transfer cards
    - User selects card (since it has to be the last card in a pile, by pile?)
    - Card gets moved from its original position to a new position of the user's choice
    - Check if the location the user chooses is a valid position (ie, the card rank is one lower than the one before it, and the opposite suit color)
- Give user the ability to draw new cards
    - User can draw one card from the stock (deck), and play it, if they are physically unable to play this card it goes to the waste
- Display cards
